        <h2> Phishing </h2>
        <p class="left">With more and more business being done online, whether it be shopping or banking, there is more risk to navigating the Internet on a daily basis. In a popular online scam known as "phishing," scammers send consumers an
          <span>e-mail that appears to be from a well-known source</span>, for example, an internet service provider or a bank. The victim is asked to <span> provide personal information</span>, like passwords or credit card numbers, which are then
          used by a scammer to commit fraud and spend the victimâ€™s money.
